PUBLIC analytics tools for the people about political systems in order to make more informed decisions.

This project's purpose is to build tools and systems in order to collect publicly available legal information available online and in other databases, make it accessible and more visual, and layer analytics tools inside a public free dashboard.
We have technologies that have optimized so many other aspects of life, maybe it's time to use it for others.
